# Biography

Alex is an executive with broad experience as an entrepreneur, mentor, technical advisor, public speaker, and developer.

I'm a versatile engineer with global experience managing and developing
projects from small webapps to the largest virtual worlds, from designing and
building supercomputers for fluid dynamics research to controlling the world's
largest optical telescope. For me, the scope of the problem to be solved at
scale is interesting regardless of the size of the codebase, userbase, or
installation. I also specialize in cloud engineering projects with a focus on 
strategic direction and large scale systems.

I'm also an advisor and mentor to various SMEs with a focus on technical
strategy and rapid product development/testing. I tend to work with firms that
define themselves by their social impact as well as profits.
